**Passkey and Biometrics:**

* This option allows you to use biometric authentication ([Touch ID or Face ID](account-security.md#how-can-i-change-my-two-factor-authantication-2fa-settings)) or a [Secret Key](account-security.md#how-can-i-change-my-two-factor-authantication-2fa-settings) for an added layer of security.
* To activate this, select the preferred method and confirm your choice with your password at the end of the setup.

**Phone Number:**

* You can set up your phone number for 2FA, which adds an additional step of verification by sending a code to your mobile device whenever there is a login attempt.
* Enter your phone number and confirm the setup by entering your password.

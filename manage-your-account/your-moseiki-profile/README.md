# Your Moseiki Profile

Setting up your Moseiki profile allows you to express your identity and connect with the community. Through your profile, you can manage your posts, stories, replies, and more. Your profile is also where you can track your interactions, like your posts, followers, and likes, making it a central hub for your Moseiki experience.

* [Customize your appearance](edit-your-profile.md) with a profile picture, personal information, and links.
* Access and analyze your statistics, including number of posts, followers, following, likes, and more.
* Manage your content through tabs for [Posts](navigate-your-content.md#posts-tab), [Stories](navigate-your-content.md#stories-tab), [Replies](navigate-your-content.md#replies-tab), and [Saved](navigate-your-content.md#saved-tab) items.
* Use tools such as [Edit Profile](edit-your-profile.md), Add Friends, Share Profile, and manage your [Wallet](../../moseiki-features/blockchain-wallet.md) for a tailored experience.
* Edit the [Account Settings](../sign-up-and-get-started/account-settings.md) like Subscribtions, Notifications and more.

# Vibe Points

**How to Earn Vibe Points**

You can earn Vibe Points through the following missions:

1. **Daily Missions**:
   * These are recurring tasks that must be completed each day to earn points.
   * Partial completion of a task does not earn points; you must complete the entire mission.
2. **Phase Missions**:
   * These are one-time tasks that must be completed within a specific phase.
3. **Referrals**:
   * Earn extra points when new users sign up using your referral codes.

**Important Notes About Vibe Points**

* **No Monetary Value**: Vibe Points cannot be redeemed for cash or other monetary assets.
* **Daily Reset**: Points must be claimed by the end of each day. Any unclaimed points will expire at midnight and cannot roll over to the next day.
* **Progress Impact**: Missing a day of claiming points will not reset your program enrollment, but failing to complete even one mission will reset your phase progress.

By earning Vibe Points and completing all missions, youâ€™ll unlock exclusive rewards and be part of something truly special. Stay consistent, and make every point count!

## Your Key to the Moseiki Universe: Moseiki Handle

Moseiki is committed to empowering its users. That's why they've created Moseiki Handles: personalized domain NFTs that act as your key to unlocking the full potential of the Moseiki app.

It's not just an identifier; it's a digital asset you control. Moseiki puts the power in your hands, allowing you to decide how you want to engage with the platform.

Owning a Moseiki Handle goes beyond simply having an account. It signifies your membership in a community that values user autonomy. With your Moseiki Handle, you're not just a participant; you're a builder, shaping your own journey within the Moseiki universe.

When signing up on Moseiki, you are required to reserve a handle. You can then mint this handle as NFT to secure the rights to use it on your profile. Once minted, you can keep your handle as long as you like or you can list it on the Shop. As soon as the requested bid is matched by another user or a user buys out the handle, the rights to use the handle is transferred to their account.

If you reserve a handle but do not proceed to finish the minting process, another user can make a bid to reserve and mint the handle. In this case, you will get a notification to decide whether to mint the handle for yourself or allow the bidding user to obtain the rights to the handle.

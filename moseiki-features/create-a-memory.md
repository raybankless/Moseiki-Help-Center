# Create a Memory

On Moseiki, every post you create has a lifespan of 22 days on the platform. As this period nears its end, you’ll receive timely notifications—first when there are only 2 days left, and again 2 hours before the deletion of the post. These reminders serve as a prompt for you to preserve your content.

To keep your post beyond its initial 22-day visibility, you can convert it into a Memory. This process essentially transforms your post into a non-fungible token (NFT) on the Xion blockchain. Creating a Memory archives the original post data within the NFT, ensuring it remains accessible and secure on the blockchain.

Moreover, by converting your post into a Memory, you open up possibilities to monetize it. Whether through direct sales or licensing, converting your content into an NFT allows you to potentially generate revenue from your digital creations\

<summary>How to keep a post as a Memory</summary>

On Moseiki, every post you create has a lifespan of 22 days on the platform. As this period nears its end, you’ll receive timely notifications—first when there are only 2 days left, and again 2 hours before the deletion of the post. These reminders serve as a prompt for you to preserve your content.

To keep your post beyond its initial 22-day visibility, you can convert it into a Memory. This process essentially transforms your post into a non-fungible token (NFT) on the Xion blockchain. Creating a Memory archives the original post data within the NFT, ensuring it remains accessible and secure on the blockchain.

Moreover, by converting your post into a Memory, you open up possibilities to monetize it. Whether through direct sales or licensing, converting your content into an NFT allows you to potentially generate revenue from your digital creations

<summary>Selling Options for NFTs in Moseiki</summary>

**Buy Now :** The "Buy Now" option allows users to purchase the NFT immediately at a fixed price set by the seller. This is ideal for users who want to acquire the NFT quickly without waiting for an auction to end.

**Place a Bid :** With the "Place a Bid" option, users can participate in an auction by submitting their bid amount. The highest bid at the end of the auction period wins the NFT. This option is suitable for those looking to purchase NFTs potentially below the "Buy Now" price or engage in competitive bidding.

**Counter Offer :** The "Counter Offer" option allows the seller to set a time duration during which users can place their bids. At the end of the specified duration, the seller must decide which bid to accept. If no bids are accepted within the timeframe, the asset stops being listed. This method adds a sense of urgency and encourages competitive bidding within a limited time window.

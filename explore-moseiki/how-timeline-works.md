# How Timeline Works

The Moseiki App Feed is designed to let you share with and connect to the people and things that matter most to you. Each time you launch or refresh the app, the top of your feed will feature photos and videos that we believe are most relevant to your interests. Beyond posts from those you follow and your favorite hashtags, you might also discover suggested accounts tailored to your preferences.

### Posts you see on your Moseiki Timeline

Your timeline displays the [For You](search-and-explore.md#for-you-page) tab by default. This tab curates posts based on your selected interests. If you haven't specified any interests in your profile, the platform uses intelligent content recommendations, subtly inferred from other aspects of your profile, such as past interactions like time spent on posts, likes, and comments.

The selection process is driven by a sophisticated algorithm designed to personalize your experience by presenting content that aligns with your preferences and engagement patterns.

# How Timeline Works

The Moseiki App Feed is designed to let you share with and connect to the people and things that matter most to you. Each time you launch or refresh the app, the top of your feed will feature photos and videos that we believe are most relevant to your interests. Beyond posts from those you follow and your favorite hashtags, you might also discover suggested accounts tailored to your preferences.
